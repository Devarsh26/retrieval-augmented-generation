Senior Finance Consultant     Company Name   －   City  ,   State      Engaged with four companies over this period ranging from Granite City Electric a small, family-owned company to Staples, Sun Life Financial and Saint Gobain; I was brought in to hold interim senior finance roles and work closely with the executive teams through periods of transition.  Major Achievements:.  Even with robust ERP systems in place at Staples, the need to bridge various stand-alone systems was identified and I created an inventory database to track existing store assets while enabling real-time \"what-if\" analysis and cost planning related to proposed changes improving efficiency and predictive capabilities.  With multiple global ERP systems in place at Saint Gobain, the executive team was looking for a dynamic and robust \"one-stop\", menu-driven reporting tool that I created utilizing Business Objects, advanced Excel and VBA increasing analytical capabilities and key metric analysis.

Major Achievements:.  Balancing the push and pull between sales efforts and maintaining margins was the focus of the Request for Proposal (RfP) tracking and analysis tool I developed to manage the contract review and approval process.  Integrating two processes performed using MS Excel and monitored individually, I created and linked a sales pricing database with a cost identification database to foster improved sales decisions by bringing finance, sales and technical operations together in a formalized review.  Telecommunications expenses represent 40% of total operating expenses at Sidera.  Ensuring the accurate tracking and timely payment of these customer impacting costs are crucial.  I created a circuit inventory tracking database to facilitate accurate cost analysis and reporting which resulted in a zero network outage rate over the subsequent two year period with $100K of estimated annual savings in penalties and fees.

With the focus on closing the books and producing standard reporting, meaningful analysis was an after-thought.  In order to provide the leadership team with better tools I established a database solution mapping each individual billing system to my data warehouse with an export into Lawson that allowed for a timely and accurate close in less than five days.
